# cooptest

This is the coop technical project. I wanted to challenge myself and try a whole new architechture with this app, using VIPER.
It was interesting to say the least, below are the instructions on how to build the project. 
Thanks!

Specs
- Xcode 11.2
- Swift 5
- Alamofire 

Open Zip file, this will have the Co-op Joker app inside.

- Go inside the unzipped CoopJokerApp folder
- Double click the Co-op Joker App.xcworkspace project, this will open the project up.
- Choose a device you wish to run the app on and build!


Thanks again hope to hear from you soon!
